# SHA256

SHA-256 hashing algorithm, written in C++ 

## How does the program works:
1) The file with the string to be hashed <br />
  1.1 You can add your own file <br />
  1.2 You can edit the default "text.txt" file
2) You have to enter the name of the file ("text.txt")
3) On the console will be printed the hash value and it will be saved automaticly in "result.txt" file <br />
  NOTE: if the result.txt file is deleted the hash value will be printed on the console but not saved!
4) To be added: Printing all saved has values
